R Markdown Slide Utilities contains functions you can use to add custom content to R Markdown slide decks, including:

- Generate image builds from a series of PNG files 

- Embed summary charts from a Google Form survey

- Add emojis with quotations

- Generate small HTML pages for exercise hints and solutions, populated by a Google Sheet, with an option to create bitly links to insert in a Rmd or R file

- Customize the CSS of SVGs created by DiagrammeR (*coming soon*)

# Installation

`slideutils` is on GitHub as well as R-universe. You can install it with:

```
options(repos = c(ajlyons = 'https://ajlyons.r-universe.dev',
                 CRAN = 'https://cloud.r-project.org'))
install.packages('slideutils')
```

OR

```
remotes::install_github("ucanr-igis/slideutils")
```

\

To see if its working:

```
library(slideutils)
```

# History

These utilities were originally part of the [`wrkshputils`](https://github.com/ucanr-igis/wrkshputils) package. They were split off into their own package mostly to make `wrkshputils` lighter, and because the functions in slideutils are generally only needed by slide content creators.
